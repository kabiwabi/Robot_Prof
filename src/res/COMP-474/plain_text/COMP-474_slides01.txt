1.21Summary I
“Data is the new oil”
Organizations have invaluable knowledge “hidden” in documents:
Products, inventions, solutions, techniques, experiences, insights, . . .
NLP/Text Mining can unlock this knowledge
What do you need?
Need business vision to drive adoption
Technology is mature and foundations are open source
E.g., IBM’s UIMA or University of Shefﬁeld’s GATE
Risks
Increasing legal and ethical concerns
E.g., Ethical AI, Responsible AI, Explainable AIRené Witte

“Input sentences are analyzed on the basis of decomposition rules which
are triggered by key words appearing in the input text. Responses are gen-

1.59GPT-2: The “unicorn” example
Human Input
“In a shocking ﬁnding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote,
previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the
researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.”GPT-2 Generated Output
“The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid’s Unicorn.
These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.
Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon
is ﬁnally solved.
Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several
companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley,
with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared
to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.
Pérez and the others then ventured further into the valley. “By the time we reached
the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,” said Pérez.”

1.60Another example...
Human Input
“For today’s homework assignment, please describe the reasons for the US Civil
War.”GPT-2 Generated Output
“It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so
many books and so much television and ﬁlms tell us that it was the cause, that it
has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement
that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of
slavery. But that’s not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War.
Many people think of the war as about states rights. Y ou’re not wrong about that,
but it’s kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conﬂict between states’
rights and federalism. So let’s try again. What’s the idea that has inspired so many
people to go onto the battleﬁelds of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and
Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic–a notion of
limited government–is a great part of the history....”

1.61GPT-2 Release Controversy
Initial Announcement
OpenAI announced GPT -2 in February 14, 2019
https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/
They initially refused to make the model or training data public, saying that it is
too dangerous, with potential misuse for generating fake news or for phishing
purposes, identity theft, manipulation of social media content, etc.
This was harshly criticized by many members of the research community

too dangerous, with potential misuse for generating fake news or for phishing
purposes, identity theft, manipulation of social media content, etc.
This was harshly criticized by many members of the research community
