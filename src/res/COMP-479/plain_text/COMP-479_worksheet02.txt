COMP 479/6791 Lab Assignment 2 Fall 2023
Objectives: Downloading a text collection from an outside source, preprocessing the collection.
Getting started:
1. Download the Reuters collection Reuters-21578 ( http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/
testcollections/reuters21578/ ). How many documents does reut2-020.sgm contain?
How many does reut2-021.sgm contain? How can you nd this information?
2. Break reut2-021.sgm up into articles, associating the NEWID with the article text.
3. Investigate, how to extract the text from the article document.
4. Answer the following question: For each of the orgs in all-orgs-strings.lc.txt, determine how
often they occur in the corpus. How did you nd your answer? Try another way. Do you
get the same answer? What is the dierence (time, eort,...)?
Advanced:
1. What is a spliterator?
2. Using the Reuters collection Reuters-21578, use Java lists to associate each of the places in
all-places-strings.lc.txt with all the NEWIDs of articles in which that place occurs. You may
use the metadata or use the main text
3. Experiment with streaming the data
4. \Clean" the text using NLTK in a nondestructive fashion (i.e. without loosing the metadata)
5. Tokenize reut2-021.sgm using NLTK. What do you observe?
