COMP 479/6791 Lab Assignment 1 Fall 2023
Objectives: Getting started with the NLTK environment. Exploring the Reuter's corpus. \Text
cleaning"
Due: second week of September
Readings: Chapters 1,2,3 in NLTK book: Natural Language Processing with Python | Analyz-
ing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit , by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper( https:
//www.nltk.org/book/ )
Description:
1. install NLTK3, the Natural Language Toolkit
2. download the version of the Reuters corpus available in NLTK
3. In the Reuters corpus, what are the number of
(a) documents? (b) words? (c) sentences?
4. For the text with leID `training/9920', determine the number of
(d) words? (e) single word prepositions? (see
https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/prepositions )
5. In NLTK, create a table that lists leIDs for each of the 90 categories. Retain a copy of this
index.
6. Write a function word freq() that takes a word and a leID, and computes the frequency of
the word in that le.
7. Download NLTK Reuters and
inspect the les (maybe in Emacs or textedit, etc). Is a le equal to a newspaper article?
inspect a newspaper article (maybe 9920?). Are all the characters part of the printed
article?
begin data preprocessing (or cleaning). What is the data that is not part of the printed
article? Why is it there? Can you extract the original printed text? Can you do it
without losing the extra information? What could that be used for? (This component
will not be tested later but is essential now.)
Outcome: Compare results with colleagues during lab time.
